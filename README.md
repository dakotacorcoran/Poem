<h1>Endurance</h1>
<p>Like the rest of us, the cactus begins its life wherevfer the roots take to embed</p>
<p>Delicate and small, without a shoulder to lean its head</p>
<p>To survive it must improvise, raising spikes to show its might</p>
<p>It stands tall and <strong>alone</strong>, <strong>protected</strong> by its pricks
<br>
<p><strong>Guarded</strong></p>
<p>The cactus hold sits own against the harshest conditions</p>
<p>Harsh condition after harsh condition</p>
<p>The cactus stands <strong>alone</strong>
<p>Protecting itself from the trauma of the desert</p>
<p>Much like people, there is only so much this little cactus can take</p>
<br>
<p>A roadrunner comes and perches on its arm, pecking at it to reach its succulent inside, taking a drink of vulnerability</p>
<p><strong>Breaking its skin</strong>, allowing fungus and infection to <strong>fester</strong></p>
<p>And fester they do</p>
<p>It can no longer hold its own</p>
<br>
<p>It starts to rot</p>
<p><strong>Hurting</strong>, after all these years</p>
<p>Nothing to come to its aid</p>
